# AI-DrivenRetailAnalytics
 Recommendations and Market Basket Insights
### Project Description
This project focuses on building an **AI-driven recommendation system** for retail stores, aimed at adapting to changing consumer preferences and leveraging AI to deliver **personalized shopping experiences**. It combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and market basket analysis to provide tailored product recommendations, boost customer engagement, and drive sales.

---

### Features
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**:
- Collaborative filtering to suggest items based on user purchase patterns.
- Content-based filtering to match recommendations with user preferences.
- **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)**:
- FP-Growth algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
- Insights on co-purchased items for promotional strategies.
- **Customer Segmentation**:
- K-means clustering to group customers based on purchasing behaviors, demographics, and coupon usage.
- Personalized marketing campaigns tailored to each segment.
- **Data Visualization**:
- Heatmaps, bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Performance Evaluation**:
- Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Conversion Rate (CVR).
- A/B testing to validate the effectiveness of recommendations.

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

### Usage Instructions
1. **Data Preparation**:
- Place your retail transaction data in the `data/` folder.
- Ensure the data follows the format specified in the project documentation.
2. **Run Exploratory Data Analysis**:
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file and execute the EDA cells to visualize key trends and insights.
3. **Generate Recommendations**:
- Run the `recommendation_system.py` script to generate personalized product suggestions.
4. **Perform Market Basket Analysis**:
- Execute the `market_basket_analysis.py` script to discover frequently bought-together items.
5. **Evaluate Model Performance**:
- Use the evaluation metrics (CTR, CVR, etc.) to assess the effectiveness of recommendations.

### Limitations and Challenges
1. **Data Quality**:
- Sparse or biased data can impact model performance.
- Cold start problems for new users/items.
2. **Computational Bottlenecks**:
- High memory usage for large datasets.
- Long processing times for clustering and rule mining.
3. **Sampling Constraints**:
- Reduced recall due to incomplete data coverage.
